### Generate a shell command: 

Command optimized for shell commands.

    shgpt shell "Command to search replace in files recursive in current directory"
    # -> find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/search/replace/g' {} \;

    shgpt shell "command to change origin of a git repo"
    # -> git remote set-url origin <new url>

Add the -e flag to execute the command:

    shgpt shell "Command to search replace in files recursive in current directory" -e
    # -> Execute command: find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/search/replace/g' {} \; ? Sure you want to continue? [Y/n]
